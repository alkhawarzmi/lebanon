                  <h2>Why?</h2>
                  <p>About half a year after the start of the Revolution, it became clear that we cannot expect solutions from the same Ruling System (a corrupt Kleptocratic system) that brought us to financial ruin. It is time to define a Vision, Principle and Values for a Country that we all dream of.</p>

                  <p>We Started the Revolution with friends and family. After a while, we found ourselves in different revolutionary groups, that we got acquainted with through street demonstrations and/or meetings, with whom we built “trust”. The circle continued to grow until we reached a place where we found ourselves unable to advance further for several reasons. Some tried to engage with the opposition independent parties and groups that were present at the outbreak of the Revolution. However, the majority did not find, in these parties (and/or) groups, neither the readiness (or intent ) to receive new associates, nor inclusive ways to work together other than the regular methods of established parties.</p>
                  <p>Consequently, we now find ourselves among several revolutionary groups, facing the ego of some, the lack of clarity of intentions of others, and the odd rejections of any attempt to organize the work of the groups. Simultaneously, it has become clear that there is a generational conflict and clash of cultures within the groups of the Revolution in all regions. All this compounded with a lack of experience in the political in the collective work of a number of revolutionaries has made progress difficult.</p>
                  <p>Despite all these challenges and obstacles, a number of individuals have managed to organize their groups effectively. Additionally, a number of them have started to structure themselves and some have even taken the first steps in establishing the new emerging parties. Still, these groups cannot be sufficiently effective at the national level, if they do not grow in size and/or they do not align with other groups to achieve critical mass. As a minimum they need to coordinate, cooperate, or consider merging together, into an effective “alternative” or “opposition”. The majority of groups remain disorganized and ‘random’, reacting to events without planning, instead of strategizing, planning and proactively working towards change.</p>
                  <p>Many who had supported the Revolution, that epitomized the dreams of most Lebanese, including many individuals and small groups (family or companions) have despaired and are now standing on the sidelines, as spectators, whence they were once actively taking part in street demonstrations.  Some have even gone as far as to sympathize with the current government, in a desperate attempt to cling to some hope, given the outside perception of the revolution as rudderless and leaderless.</p>
                  <hr>
                  <h2>The Objective</h2>
                  <p>The lack of ‘leadership’ that used to be a strength, has now become a weakness. Leadership does not necessarily mean a top down in the classic sense of the word, but more in the setting of clear direction, and a coherent strategic plan.</p>
                  <p>We do not want to follow a "person", we want to follow an "idea", a "project" that could achieve our dreams.</p>
                  <p>We want Leaders to lead us where?</p>
                  <p>How can we guarantee that the chosen leaders will take us where we want?</p>
                  <p>This initiative is an attempt to define the "Direction", the vision, and the Values and Principles that we should all abide with.</p> 
                  <hr>
                  <h2>How?</h2>
                  <p>The current version is a draft, and the survey is open for anyone to participate. Based on the results, feedback, and discussions, we will release a new version every 2 months, and run another survery.</p>
                  <p>We will repeat the process until we have a final document.</p>

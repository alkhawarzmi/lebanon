                  <p>Over six months have passed since the start of the Revolution and it is clear that we cannot expect solutions from the same Ruling System (a corrupt Kleptocratic System) that brought us to financial ruin.</p>
                  <h2>Who we are?</h2>
                  <p>Like many of you, we are Lebanese that took to the streets to revolt against this corrupt system. We all started the Revolution with friends and family. After a while, we found ourselves in different revolutionary groups, through street demonstrations and/or meetings, and with whom we have built “trust”.</p>
                  <p>The circle continued to grow until we found ourselves unable to advance further for several (internal/external) reasons. Some tried to engage with the opposition independent parties and groups that were present at the outbreak of the Revolution. However, the majority did not find, in these parties (and/or) groups, neither the readiness (or intent) to receive new associates, nor inclusive ways to work together, other than the regular old methods of the established parties.</p>
                  <h2>Why this initiative?</h2>
                  <p>We now find ourselves amongst several revolutionary groups, facing the ego of some, the lack of clarity of intentions of others, and the odd rejections of any attempt to organize the work of the groups.</p>
                  <p>It has also become clear that there is a generational conflict and some discrepancies within the same group of the many Revolutionary groups. All this is compounded by the lack of experience of a number of revolutionaries, in political and collective work, which has made progress difficult.</p>
                  <p>This has resulted in the majority of groups remaining somewhat disorganized and ‘random’, reacting to events instead of taking the offense. Some efforts do exist today to organize, yet what is needed are clear strategies, tactics, coherent planning and proactive collaboration and cooperation, towards effective change.</p>
                  <p>Many who had supported the Revolution, including many individuals and small groups have despaired and are now standing on the sidelines, as spectators, whence they were once actively taking part in street demonstrations.  Worse still, some have even gone as far as to sympathize with the current government, in a desperate attempt to cling to false hopes, given the false perception of the revolution as being rudderless and leaderless.</p>
                  <p>Despite all these challenges and obstacles, a number of individuals have managed to organize their groups effectively. Additionally, a number of them have started to structure themselves and some have even taken the first steps in establishing the new emerging parties.</p>
                  <p>Still, these groups cannot be sufficiently effective at the national level, if they do not grow in size and/or they do not align with other groups to achieve critical mass. As a minimum they need to coordinate, cooperate, or consider merging together, into an effective “alternative” or “opposition”.</p>
                  <p><em>We do not have any personal political ambition, we are just a few concerned Citizens.</em></p>
                  <h2>The Objective</h2>
                  <p>The lack of ‘leadership’ that used to be a strength, has now become a weakness. To be clear, leadership does not necessarily mean top down in the classic sense of the word, but more in the setting of clear direction, and alignment around a coherent strategic plan.</p>
                  <p>It is time to define a Vision, Values, and Principles for the Country we all dream of.</p>
                  <hr>
                  <p>The first step to move forward is to answer the question: <strong>What do we agree on (and not only on what we disagree on)?</strong></p>
                  <p>We do not want to follow a "person".</p>
                  <p>We want to follow an "idea/concept" or a "project" that would achieve our dreams.</p>
                  <p>We cannot reach the country we want without Organization.</p>
                  <p>We cannot organize without Planning.</p>
                  <p>We cannot plan without a Vision.</p>
                  <p>This is an experiment to try and define a common vision and set of Values and Principles for Lebanon.</p>
                  <h2>How?</h2>
                  <p>This current version is a draft. The survey is open for anyone to participate (anonymously by choice), view the results and use them any way they want. If you would like to receive future updates and/or participate in future discussions, you are free to share with us, your Full Name and Email address.</p>
                  <p>In case we receive <strong>1000+ responses</strong>, we will open and organize the discussions, and those who registered will receive an email with instructions to follow.</p>
                  <p>In case the target is not reached, we hope that the survey and the results will open the discussions between people and within groups on the importance of properly defining the Vision, Values and Principles.</p>

                <p>Over six months have passed since the start of the Revolution and it is clear that we cannot expect solutions from the same Ruling System (a corrupt Kleptocratic System) that brought us to financial ruin.</p>
                <h2>Who we are?</h2>
                <p>Like many of you, we are Lebanese that took to the streets to revolt against this corrupt system. We all started the Revolution with friends and family. After a while, we found ourselves in different revolutionary groups, through street demonstrations and/or meetings, and with whom we have built “trust”.</p>
                <p>The circle continued to grow until we found ourselves unable to advance further for several (internal/external) reasons. Some tried to engage with the opposition independent parties and groups that were present at the outbreak of the Revolution. However, the majority did not find, in these parties (and/or) groups, neither the readiness (or intent) to receive new associates, nor inclusive ways to work together, other than the regular old methods of the established parties.</p>
                <h2>Why this initiative?</h2>
                <p>We now find ourselves amongst several revolutionary groups, facing the ego of some, the lack of clarity of intentions of others, and the odd rejections of any attempt to organize the work of the groups.</p>
                <p>It has also become clear that there is a generational conflict and some discrepancies within the same group of the many Revolutionary groups. All this is compounded by the lack of experience of a number of revolutionaries, in political and collective work, which has made progress difficult.</p>
                <p>This has resulted in the majority of groups remaining somewhat disorganized and ‘random’, reacting to events instead of taking the offense. Some efforts do exist today to organize, yet what is needed are clear strategies, tactics, coherent planning and proactive collaboration and cooperation, towards effective change.</p>
                <p>Many who had supported the Revolution, including many individuals and small groups have despaired and are now standing on the sidelines, as spectators, whence they were once actively taking part in street demonstrations.  Worse still, some have even gone as far as to sympathize with the current government, in a desperate attempt to cling to false hopes, given the false perception of the revolution as being rudderless and leaderless.</p>
                <p>Despite all these challenges and obstacles, a number of individuals have managed to organize their groups effectively. Additionally, a number of them have started to structure themselves and some have even taken the first steps in establishing the new emerging parties.</p>
                <p>Still, these groups cannot be sufficiently effective at the national level, if they do not grow in size and/or they do not align with other groups to achieve critical mass. As a minimum they need to coordinate, cooperate, or consider merging together, into an effective “alternative” or “opposition”.</p>
                <p><em>We do not have any personal political ambition, we are just a few concerned Citizens.</em></p>
                <h2>The Objective</h2>
                <p>The lack of ‘leadership’ that used to be a strength, has now become a weakness. To be clear, leadership does not necessarily mean top down in the classic sense of the word, but more in the setting of clear direction, and alignment around a coherent strategic plan.</p>
                <p>It is time to define a Vision, Values, and Principles for the Country we all dream of.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>The first step to move forward is to answer the question: <strong>What do we agree on (and not only on what we disagree on)?</strong></p>
                <p>We do not want to follow a "person".</p>
                <p>We want to follow an "idea/concept" or a "project" that would achieve our dreams.</p>
                <p>We cannot reach the country we want without Organization.</p>
                <p>We cannot organize without Planning.</p>
                <p>We cannot plan without a Vision.</p>
                <p>This is an experiment to try and define a common vision and set of Values and Principles for Lebanon.</p>
                <h2>How?</h2>
                <p>This current version is a draft. The survey is open for anyone to participate (anonymously by choice), view the results and use them any way they want. If you would like to receive future updates and/or participate in future discussions, you are free to share with us, your Full Name and Email address.</p>
                <p>In case we receive <strong>1000+ responses</strong>, we will open and organize the discussions, and those who registered will receive an email with instructions to follow.</p>
                <p>In case the target is not reached, we hope that the survey and the results will open the discussions between people and within groups on the importance of properly defining the Vision, Values and Principles.</p>

                <h2>The Vision</h2>

                <blockquote><small>We aim for Lebanon to be:</small></blockquote>

                <ol>
                  <li>A free, democratic and independent sovereign State, and a final homeland to all its Citizens.</li>
                  <li>A state free from sectarianism, feudalism, tribalism, nepotism, clientelism, and regionalism, redefined by a new and modern social contract between it and the Citizens in a way that is compatible with the requirements of development and modernity.</li>
                  <li>A State that respects the total separation of powers, between the Executive, Legislative and Judicial Bodies of the State  and that enacts laws that prohibit the interference in the nomination of Judges and in Judicial affairs.</li>
                  <li>A State where Religion is a personal matter separate from public affairs and politics <sup>*</sup>.</li>
                  <li>A State where the decision of War and Peace is vested in the competent constitutional bodies and the prerogative and exclusivity of arms is legally confined to the Lebanese State, and subject to the principle of sovereignty.</li>
                  <li>A State that genuinely protects all Liberties, including freedom of speech and the right to participate in political, social and cultural life and activities, within the boundaries and protection of the Constitution and the current laws.</li>
                  <li>A State that genuinely protects basic civil rights , and treats all of its citizens equally and fairly under the rule of Law, irrespective of age, gender, sexual preference, race, or religious beliefs, socio-economic situation and level of education, without exceptions.</li>
                  <li>A State that promotes a culture of efficiency, integrity, transparency and accountability.</li>
                  <li>A State whose competent apparatuses continuously monitor and combat Corruption and abuse of power.</li>
                  <li>A State built on a dynamic , modern merit-based administration framed by the highest standards of ethics, efficiency, and proper governance  in caring for public affairs, and constantly improving performance in accordance with the highest international standards.</li>
                  <li>A State that labors to reduce social inequities and raise the standard of living of all its citizens.</li>
                  <li>A State that provides and guarantees, free of charge to its citizens, the highest standards Healthcare, Education, and other welfare services, in alignment and support for a growing, progressive, productive, efficient and sustainable open economy, free from monopolistic practices, that would achieve a fair and balanced development, across all Lebanese regions, to enable and empower its citizens to live in dignity and to freely create, innovate and prosper.</li>
                  <li>A State where the Banking sector promotes the building of productive (and non-passive) capacities in the economy, and shields the sector from any Conflict of Interests and from any Political interference, whatsoever.</li>
                  <li>A State that harnesses its energies to preserve a clean, healthy, and green environment and to respect and protect its biodiversity.</li>
                  <li>A State that respects and preserves the nation's cultural and historical heritage and treasures.</li>
                </ol>

                <P><sup>*</sup><em> There are different opinions on several topics. However, we do agree on many, such as the subject of the secular or civil state. There is a lot of talk about a civil or secular state, and in fact we cannot decide for an entire people. We believe that we, as the people, are unable to choose without detailed explanation and awareness campaigns. Now, we certainly agree to separate religion from the state, and we can, at a later stage, expand without disagreeing now.</em></p>

                
                <h2>Values and Principles</h2>

                <blockquote><small>We believe in and abide by, the following values and principles:</small></blockquote>

                <ol>
                  <li>Patriotism;</li>
                  <li>Democracy;</li>
                  <li>Non-violence;</li>
                  <li>Transparency;</li>
                  <li>Accountability;</li>
                  <li>Meritocracy;</li>
                  <li>Honesty;</li>
                  <li>Integrity;</li>
                  <li>Efficiency;</li>
                  <li>Responsibility.</li>
                </ol>

                <blockquote>The Citizens, in return, have the solemn duty to contribute efforts in supporting the State that shall emerge from the Vision herein, abide and respect the Constitution and the Laws, and act responsibly based on the Values, Principles above.</blockquote>

                  <h2>The Vision</h2>

                  <blockquote><small>We aim for Lebanon to be:</small></blockquote>

                  <ol>
                    <li>A free, democratic and independent sovereign State, and a final homeland to all its Citizens.</li>
                    <li>A state free from sectarianism, feudalism, tribalism, nepotism, clientelism, and regionalism, redefined by a new and modern social contract between it and the Citizens in a way that is compatible with the requirements of development and modernity.</li>
                    <li>A State that respects the total separation of powers, between the Executive, Legislative and Judicial Bodies of the State  and that enacts laws that prohibit the interference in the nomination of Judges and in Judicial affairs.</li>
                    <li>A State where Religion is a personal matter separate from public affairs and politics <sup>*</sup>.</li>
                    <li>A State where the decision of War and Peace is vested in the competent constitutional bodies and the prerogative and exclusivity of arms is legally confined to the Lebanese State, and subject to the principle of sovereignty.</li>
                    <li>A State that genuinely protects all Liberties, including freedom of speech and the right to participate in political, social and cultural life and activities, within the boundaries and protection of the Constitution and the current laws.</li>
                    <li>A State that genuinely protects basic civil rights , and treats all of its citizens equally and fairly under the rule of Law, irrespective of age, gender, sexual preference, race, or religious beliefs, socio-economic situation and level of education, without exceptions.</li>
                    <li>A State that promotes a culture of efficiency, integrity, transparency and accountability.</li>
                    <li>A State whose competent apparatuses continuously monitor and combat Corruption and abuse of power.</li>
                    <li>A State built on a dynamic , modern merit-based administration framed by the highest standards of ethics, efficiency, and proper governance  in caring for public affairs, and constantly improving performance in accordance with the highest international standards.</li>
                    <li>A State that labors to reduce social inequities and raise the standard of living of all its citizens.</li>
                    <li>A State that provides and guarantees, free of charge to its citizens, the highest standards Healthcare, Education, and other welfare services, in alignment and support for a growing, progressive, productive, efficient and sustainable open economy, free from monopolistic practices, that would achieve a fair and balanced development, across all Lebanese regions, to enable and empower its citizens to live in dignity and to freely create, innovate and prosper.</li>
                    <li>A State where the Banking sector promotes the building of productive (and non-passive) capacities in the economy, and shields the sector from any Conflict of Interests and from any Political interference, whatsoever.</li>
                    <li>A State that harnesses its energies to preserve a clean, healthy, and green environment and to respect and protect its biodiversity.</li>
                    <li>A State that respects and preserves the nation's cultural and historical heritage and treasures.</li>
                  </ol>

                  <P><sup>*</sup><em> There are different opinions on several topics. However, we do agree on many, such as the subject of the secular or civil state. There is a lot of talk about a civil or secular state, and in fact we cannot decide for an entire people. We believe that we, as the people, are unable to choose without detailed explanation and awareness campaigns. Now, we certainly agree to separate religion from the state, and we can, at a later stage, expand without disagreeing now.</em></p>

                  
                  <h2>Values and Principles</h2>

                  <blockquote><small>We believe in and abide by, the following values and principles:</small></blockquote>

                  <ol>
                    <li>Patriotism;</li>
                    <li>Democracy;</li>
                    <li>Non-violence;</li>
                    <li>Transparency;</li>
                    <li>Accountability;</li>
                    <li>Meritocracy;</li>
                    <li>Honesty;</li>
                    <li>Integrity;</li>
                    <li>Efficiency;</li>
                    <li>Responsibility.</li>
                  </ol>

                  <blockquote>The Citizens, in return, have the solemn duty to contribute efforts in supporting the State that shall emerge from the Vision herein, abide and respect the Constitution and the Laws, and act responsibly based on the Values, Principles above.</blockquote>
